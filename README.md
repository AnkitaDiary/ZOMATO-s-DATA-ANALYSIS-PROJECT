This project involves an in-depth analysis of restaurant data from Zomato, focusing on customer preferences and restaurant performance. The key findings and analysis include:

1.Restaurant Type Popularity: Identified the most ordered restaurant types by analyzing customer data and visualizing trends in popular restaurant categories.                                                                           
2.Customer Engagement: Aggregated customer votes per restaurant type and visualized vote distribution to highlight customer preferences.                                                                                        
3.Customer Satisfaction: Calculated the most common ratings across restaurants to assess general customer sentiment.                                                                                                                                                      
4.Couples' Spending Patterns: Analyzed average spending of couples ordering food online to guide targeted promotions and offers.                                                                                                          
5.Online vs. Offline Ratings: Compared ratings between online and offline orders to identify satisfaction trends and improve customer engagement strategies.                                                    
6.Offline Order Analysis: Examined offline orders by restaurant type to identify potential restaurants for special offers.                                                                               
7.Impact of Table Booking on Ratings and Votes: Compared restaurants with and without table booking options to analyze the effect on ratings and votes. Found that restaurants with booking options tend to receive higher ratings.                                              
8.Restaurant Type Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of various restaurant types to identify key trends in customer preferences and assist in refining restaurant recommendations.
